# io_scene_evilengine_anm

Fork of [io_scene_bfbb_anm](https://github.com/psycrow101/io_scene_bfbb_anm):
* Added "The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer" & "Ratatouille Prototype" support
* Ensures all keyframes, including the last keyframe, are accurately imported and exported.

This plugin for Blender 3D allows you to import and export animations (`.anm`) from all Heavy Iron Studios EvilEngine (2002-2006) games. Based on [BFBBAnimTools](https://github.com/seilweiss/BFBBAnimTools).

## How to import animation

1. Import DFF model into Blender
2. Make armature active
3. Import ANM animation

## Requirements

* Blender 3D (2.81 and higher)
* [DragonFF](https://github.com/Parik27/DragonFF) or [DragonFF multi-mesh support](https://github.com/Psycrow101/DragonFF/tree/multi-mesh)
